## Interviewing Guidelines

### General

We usually run more than one interview for each candidate.
We also send them an introductory email presenting our company, our projects and our way of work.
When running your interview, you should be aware if the interview is **technical** (run by developers) or **non-technical** (performed by our Tech Lead or Country Manager).

Regardless of the type of interview, the intreview should last **only** around 1 hour after which you should send a feedback email that is only a **brief** summary with 1 or two paragraphs. In total between interview and feedback you should spend about **1.5 hours**. 

#### Technical Interviews
If you're running a technical interview, keep the following questions in mind:

* Do they seem to be quick learners?
* How is their written and spoken English? Are they at least in an intermediate level?

Ask them some of these questions:
* Tell me about an important issue you encountered recently.
* Talk about something new you learned this month.
* Do you prefer to work independently or on a team?
* What techniques and tools do you use on a daily-basis?
* If you join a project where code is using tabs for identation but you prefer spaces, what would you do?

#### Non-Technical Interviews
If you're running a non-technical interview, keep the following questions in mind:

* Why are they looking for a new job?
* Will they agree to do things the Inaka way (e.g. git, pivotal)?
* Do they understand the service business? Do they like working with clients?
* Do they have interests outside work?

Ask them some of these questions:
* Can you describe a time when your work was criticized?
* What are you expecting from this firm in the future?
* Tell me about a time when you had to adapt to a difficult situation.
* What is your greatest achievement outside of work?
* Do you think you are overqualified for this position?
* What techniques and tools do you use to keep yourself organized?
* What attracted you to this company?
* What type of work environment do you prefer?

### Technical Positions

  - For this, there are several options, among which these two are suggested:
    - Ask candidates whether their would like to solve an issue of some of our [Swift open source projects](https://inaka.github.io/). It's important to make it clear that this is **optional**. If so, suggest them to do it following the Inaka's git workflow. They can solve this after the interview, like a homework.

## General Check-List
At least in one of the interviews that we do with each candidate we need to assert the required
training period that will be needed if hired. To do that, run a ping-pong of questions with the
interviewee and check their level of expertise in our usual methodologies, practices, tools, etc.
As a bare minimum, check the items in the list below. For each one, if the candidate says that he/she has
experience on that, add a follow-up question to verify it. Examples are provided:
- [ ] git
  - [ ] Tell me about one git command that you know but not many people use regularly

  - [ ] What things do you do through command-line that you can't do with visual tools?
- [ ] code reviews / pull requests
  - [ ] What is in your mind the most important thing to keep in mind while reviewing code from others?

  - [ ] Do you write your tests before or after writing your code?
  - [ ] How often do you think it's worth it to invest time in analyzing and refactoring your code?

  - [ ] If you have a blog, show me
  - [ ] If you have written non-technical docs for an open-source library, show me
  - [ ] Do you write in english or in your native language?
